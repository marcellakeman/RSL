Python interpretation

The Python code first creates a subset where the movie title is The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King. 
All the reviewers (author's) are in this subset. 
The Metascore that has been given should be a 7 at least, so the reviewer liked the movie. 
All the reviewers are compared to the larger dataset, and a third dataset is made, where the reviewers gave a higher Metascore to another movie in the larger dataset.
This dataset is then sorted by the increased Metascore, and the higher the increased Metascore is, the better the recommendation.
The output is a csv file with 691 movie recommendations.
