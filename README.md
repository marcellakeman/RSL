# Movie recommender system
The movie recommendation system containt of 4 codes. One written in SQL and one in Python. The codes in SQL make predictions about which movie I should watch next after selecting my favourite movie: The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King. The code compares the Summary, Title or Starring field to filter out the movies that the viewer should watch next.
